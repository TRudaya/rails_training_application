Exercises (1.3.4)

    1. Change the content of the hello action in Listing 1.8 to read “hola, mundo!” instead of “hello, world!”.
    2. Show that Rails supports non-ASCII characters by including an inverted exclamation point,
       as in “¡Hola, mundo!” (Figure 1.13).17 To get a ¡ character on a Mac, you can use Option-1;
       otherwise, you can always copy-and-paste the character into your editor.
    3. By following the example of the hello action in Listing 1.8, add a second action called 
       goodbye that renders the text “goodbye, world!”. Edit the routes file from Listing 1.10 
       so that the root route goes to goodbye instead of to hello (Figure 1.14).
